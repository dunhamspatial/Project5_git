                        For this project, I utilized Google's Fusion Tables to provide data to my mashup map. 
                        Originally, I created the map using a polygon kml and transcribed the data directly to the Fusion Table.
                        After spending a significant amount of time trying to construct the code to parse the KML geometry, 
                        I scrapped the idea and started over. I decided to stick closer to the code provided by the lesson and
                        represent my data via points instead of polygons. 
                    </p>
                    <p>           
                        I restarted by converting a shapefile I had of the US states to a point shapefile via the centroids tool. I added the data
                        that I planned on displaying through editing the attribute table of the shapefile. Utilizing the service <a href="http://shpescape.com/"> Shape Escape</a>
                        allowed me to upload my shapefile directly to my fusion table. I customized the info window through the Fusion Table
                        interface, but shortly thereafter, discovered that this formatting did not carry over to my map. I perfoormed some
                        basic html formatting on the sidebar and infowindow, but ran out of time, before I found a way to format the currency properly.
                        I decided to use a customized symbol for the info markera and centered my map so that all of the markers could be seen. I utilized
                        Bootstrap for the page's framework and used small containers so I could meet my target display size of 980 pixel wide. 
                    </p>

                        The evolution of my code commits can be found here on <a href="https://github.com/dunhamspatial/Project5_git/commits/master">GitHub</a> I need
                        to work on commiting my project everytime I have made a significant change to the project. I found that I often had changed significant
                        amounts of code before I made a commit and this will make finding and correcting bugs in my code more difficult.
