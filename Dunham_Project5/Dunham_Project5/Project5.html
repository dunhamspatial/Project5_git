                        This project was built with the same stack of technology that I used in Lesson 3. The only major change was
                        that I redesigned the page's layout using the bootstrap framework with no template.
                        The greatest challenge I encountered while constructing this project was with the basemap styling. I 
                        utilized the Google styling wizard to style the map with a Neapolitan ice cream color scheme and no labels.
                        After copying the JSON code to my new customMapType variable, the map would not render. After several attempts
                        to correct the issue, I discovered that I was unable to get the code to work while I was passing the mapTypeIds
                        in through a second mapOptions variable. For some reason, all of the other parameters I declared in the mapOptions
                        variable would pass through to the map, but not the style. I eliminated the mapOption variable and provided all
                        my parameters directly via the map constructor. A smaller issue I ran into was how to utilize the marker shadow 
                        into my project. After seeing the discussion thread that marker shadows had been removed from the Gooogle Map API,
                        I decided that I would merge the two separate images into a single image, so that the shadows would still appear on my map.
                        After merging the images, I utilized the shape property to limit the clickable boundary of the image to just the
                        ice cream cone and not the shadow.
