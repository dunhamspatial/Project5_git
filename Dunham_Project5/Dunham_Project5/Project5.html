                        For this project, I utilized Google's Fusion Tables to provide data to my mashup map. 
                        Originally I created the map and data using a polygon kml and adding the data directly to the fusion table,
                        but after spending a significant amount of time trying to construct the code to parse the KML geometry, 
                        I scrapped the idea and started over. I decided to stick closer to the code provided by the lesson and
                        represent my data via points instead of polygons. 
                    </p>
                    <p>           
                        I started by converting a shapefile I had of the US states to a point shapefile via the centroids tool. I added the data
                        that I planned on displaying through editing the attribute table of the shapefile. Utilizing the service <a href="http://shpescape.com/"> Shape Escape</a>
                        allowed me to upload my shapefile directly my fusion table.

                        The evolution of my code commits can be found here on <a href="https://github.com/dunhamspatial/Project5_git/commits/master">GitHub</a> I need
                        to work on commiting my project everytime I have made a significant change to the project. I found that I often had changed significant
                        amounts of code before I made a commit and this will make finding and correcting bugs in my code more difficult.
